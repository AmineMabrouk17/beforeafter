## 📖 Overview

Keeping track of money is usually a chore: every coffee, every subscription, every freelance paycheck. BudgetIQ flips that around.

Instead of manually filling out rows of a finance app, you just **talk**. Type *"I spent $45 on groceries today"* into the assistant and BudgetIQ detects the expense, asks for confirmation, and logs it with a single click. Your dashboard — net balance, monthly spending, total assets, and category breakdowns — updates instantly.

Under the hood it pairs a **Next.js** front end with **Supabase** (PostgreSQL + Auth) for data and authentication, and the **Google Gemini API** for natural-language understanding. Everything is built on Server Actions with Row-Level Security, so your data stays yours and yours only.

### Why BudgetIQ?

- **Zero data entry fatigue** — the AI assistant does the logging for you.
- **Free & open source** — self-host it, fork it, or just use the hosted demo.
- **Private by default** — RLS-backed storage means every user only ever sees their own data.
- **Fast, modern, responsive** — a polished DaisyUI/Tailwind interface with light & dark themes.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🤖 Core Functionality
- **AI financial assistant** — a chat drawer that parses natural language, detects income / expense / asset intent, and offers a one-click confirmation card to log the transaction.
- **Transaction tracking** — log and delete **Income**, **Expenses**, and **Assets** from a single modal.
- **Financial summary cards** — at-a-glance **Net Balance**, **Monthly Spending**, and **Total Assets**.
- **Category breakdowns** — interactive Recharts visualisations of where your money goes.

### 🎨 UI / UX
- **Polished landing page** — hero with product mockup, features grid, how-it-works, testimonials, FAQ, CTA band, and footer.
- **Scroll-reveal motion** — subtle, tasteful entrance animations as sections come into view.
- **Light & dark themes** — DaisyUI theming with a persisted theme toggle.
- **Responsive everywhere** — works beautifully on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

### 🗄️ Data Handling
- **Supabase PostgreSQL** database with full **Row-Level Security** — users can only read, create, or delete their own rows.
- **Server Actions + data layer** — every operation runs as the signed-in user with strict server-side validation.
- **Auto-created profiles** — a trigger creates a profile on signup, pulling name & avatar from the auth provider.
- **Daily motivational quotes** — rotate wisdom on the dashboard to keep you motivated.

### 🔌 API Integrations
- **Supabase Auth** — Google OAuth (one-click) and email/password sign-in.
- **Google Gemini** (`gemini-3.6-flash` via the Interactions API) — structured JSON responses with schema-enforced transaction detection.
- **Quotes API** (`api-ninjas`, with fallbacks) — the daily quote feed.
- **Session-protected endpoints** — `/api/chat` and `/api/quotes` require an authenticated session.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and `pnpm` (or `npm`)
- A [Supabase](https://supabase.com) project
- A [Google Gemini](https://aistudio.google.com) API key

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmineMabrouk17/BudgetIQ.git
cd BudgetIQ
pnpm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

Copy `.env.local.example` to `.env.local` and fill it in:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL=http://localhost:3000
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-supabase-project.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-supabase-publishable-key
GEMINI_API_KEY=your-gemini-api-key
API_NINJAS_API_KEY=your-api-ninjas-api-key
```

### 3. Set up the database

Open the **SQL Editor** in your Supabase dashboard and run the schema (see `supabase/migrations/`) to create the `transactions` and `profiles` tables, their RLS policies, and the signup trigger. `lib/env.ts` enforces the required environment variables at boot.

### 4. Configure auth

Enable the **Google** provider in Supabase → Authentication → Providers, add the Supabase callback URL in Google Cloud Console, and register `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback` in **Authentication → URL Configuration**. Email/password works out of the box. For reliable verification/reset emails in production, point Supabase SMTP at a provider such as [Resend](https://resend.com).

### 5. Run locally

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and sign in.

### 6. Test

```bash
pnpm test      # Vitest + Testing Library
pnpm lint      # ESLint
```

## ☁️ Deployment

Deploy to Vercel in minutes:

1. Push this repository to GitHub and import it into Vercel.
2. Add the environment variables from step 2 (set `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITE_URL` to your production URL).
3. Deploy.
4. Add your production callback URL (e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app/auth/callback`) to Supabase → Authentication → URL Configuration.
